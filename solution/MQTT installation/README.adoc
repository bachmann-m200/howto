== Insatlling MQTT on MX2xx

For the installation of "mqtt", the following must be observed in the application

  - The openssl.o must be present on the system, even if the client does not use any security at all.
  - mqtt, openssl and MxCCore or MxCCore.all must come from the same M-Base otherwise the software module will not start properly and the SPS will boot "rot".
  - `Use extended OSÂ´ must be activated: System -> Boot parameters -> Boot Settings -> Advanced -> save.
  - If the software module does not start correctly, a system update is required
