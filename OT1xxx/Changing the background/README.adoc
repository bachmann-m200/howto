 .  	Find a desired background image and save this image as ‘1280x800.jpg’.

 . 	Using the FTP in solutioncenter, drag and drop this file from your pc to the OT in the directory called /home/vis.
  
 .	Make a connection with the OT via putty, Login with the following credentials username: vis Password: bachmann.
  
 .	  Type ‘ls’, you should now be in the /home/vis directory (you could recognize this by checking if the lconfig.ini file is there).
  
 .  	If you are in /home/vis, type ‘cd ../..’. To check type ‘ls’, you should now see the usr folder here.
  
 .	  Now type: ‘mv /home/vis/1280x800.jpg /usr/share/bachmann-config’ 
  
 .	Reboot the OT and if the steps are followed the background image should now have changed to your desired image.
