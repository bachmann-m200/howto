There are two options to obtain a license:

  1. Manual activation
      Copy the hardware code and send it to your bachmann contact. A license code will be returned,
      which has to be copied into the empty field. Confirm with OK.
      
  2. Online activation
      If you have an atvise account, choose "Online activation" and follow the activation steps.

=== Step 2. Installing an OPC UA service on the controller

To install the OPC UA the Bachmann OPCUA_Server.Vx-yy.exe has to be installed.
After the installation the OPC UA can be installed on the controller.

Go to the Online Device -> Software -> Right click 'Services' -> New -> Service.

NOTE: If there is no valid license for the OPC UA, enable the DemoMode to run the OPC UA.
      This OPC UA Demo will run for two hours, before it has to be restarted. (rebooting PLC)
      
Set the parameters as needed and confirm with finish. The complete description about these parameters are in the manual located in: bachmann\M1sw\doc\OPC UA Server.

The controller needs to reboot to finish the installation and run the OPC UA.


=== Step 3. Connect the controller to atvise®scada

Open the builder

Open My Server -> right click 'Data Sources' -> Add Data Source -> OPCUA.
