This guide shows you how to add an OPC UA service on your bachmann PLC and how to make the OPCUA connection between the M1 controller and SCADA.

=== Step 1. Getting a license for atvise®scada

First download the latest version of atvise®scada from the following link:
http://customer.atvise.com/en/customer-area-downloads-en/category/111-atvise-3-5

There are two options to obtain a license:

  1. Manual activation
      Copy the hardware code and send it to your bachmann contact. A license code will be returned,
      which has to be copied into the empty field. Confirm with OK.
      
  2. Online activation
      If you have an atvise account, choose "Online activation" and follow the activation steps.

=== Step 2. Installing an OPC UA service on the controller

To install the OPC UA the Bachmann OPCUA_Server.Vx-yy.exe has to be installed.
After the installation the OPC UA can be installed on the controller.

Go to the Online Device -> Software -> Right click 'Services' -> New -> Service.

Most likely: C:\Bachmann\Mbase\Target-M1\Bootdevice\srv.

NOTE: If there is no valid license for the OPC UA, enable the DemoMode to run the OPC UA.
      This OPC UA Demo will run for two hours, before it has to be restarted. (rebooting PLC)
      
Set the parameters as needed and confirm with finish. The complete description about these parameters are in the manual located in: bachmann\M1sw\doc\OPC UA Server.

The controller needs to reboot to finish the installation and run the OPC UA.
